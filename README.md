**Ping** was the brain child of good friend [Bennet Dalton](https://au.linkedin.com/in/bennet-dalton-myi). First released (seven years ago) as a way to find your friends when your 'out and about' and wanting to connect. Users would send and receive *'Pings'* asking for location, responding to location requests along with augmented navigation support. These requests were performed in the background via remote (push) notifications. After a couple of successful years in the market Apple released their own version called 'Find My Friends' - which was a defining pivot point towards what it is now: [Foodie-curated cafes, restaurants and bars.](https://www.pingmethen.com/) App blurb: Peruse curated maps from our favourite foodies by Vegan, Burgers, Rooftops. Get the latest in Speciality Coffee, cafe openings, new eateries.
